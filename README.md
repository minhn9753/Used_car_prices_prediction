# Predicting Used Car Prices  

This project aims to predict the prices of used cars using **linear regression**. By analyzing various independent variables, the model provides a data-driven approach to estimate car values, offering insights into the factors influencing pricing.  

### Key Features of the Dataset  
  - Brand  
  - Price  
  - Body Type  
  - Mileage  
  - Engine Volume  
  - Registration Status  
  - Year  
  - Model

- **Dependent Variables**:
  - Price
  

### Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Cleaning the dataset and handling missing values.  
   - Addressing outliers to improve model accuracy.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Analyzing Probability Density Functions (PDFs).  
   - Relaxing assumptions to ensure the data meets linear regression requirements.  

3. **Feature Engineering**:  
   - Creating dummy variables for categorical data to make it model-ready.  

4. **Model Building**:  
   - Implementing and fine-tuning a **linear regression model** to predict car prices.  

This repository provides a complete workflow from data preparation to model deployment, highlighting the key steps and methodologies used in predictive modeling for pricing.
